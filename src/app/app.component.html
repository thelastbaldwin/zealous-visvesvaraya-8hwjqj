<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This exercise is designed to simulate real-world tasks on our engineering
  team: refactoring existing Angular components for reusability and implementing
  new features across separate use cases. This isn't a test of your current
  knowledge of Angular — the focus is on code quality, clarity, reuse, and your
  ability to reason through a small front-end system. You’ll be working with two
  existing statically defined tables (amateur and pro hitting data) rendered
  with simple HTML, with a goal of consolidating shared logic and extending
  functionality.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
You’ll complete three main tasks:
<ol>
  <li>
    Add classes or interfaces to represent the different data types for better
    clarity and maintainability.
    <ul>
      <li>
        For the purposes of this exercise, the data in
        <strong>src/mockData.ts</strong> contains year by year hitting data for
        a random player with Pro and Amateur level data in recent seasons.
      </li>
      <li>
        Notice that the mock data contains different fields between Pro and
        Amateur. It's up to you to determine which fields are shared, and which
        fields are unique to each data type when constructing your
        classes/interfaces.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Refactor the two tables into a single reusable Angular component that can
    handle both pro and amateur data structures.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The existing components can be found in the
        <strong>src/hitter</strong> folder
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add background shading to the wOBA and OPS columns to visually indicate
    player performance relative to the league average for that level.
    <ul>
      <li>
        League averages and standard deviations by year and level are available
        in <strong>src/mockData.ts</strong>. (Assume these are scaled based on
        the number of plate appearances the player had at a given level)
      </li>
      <li>
        Cells representing above-average performance should be shaded green;
        below-average performance should be shaded red. The color should use a
        <i>smoothed gradient</i> from red to green based on how many standard
        deviations the player's value deviates from the average. Treat -2
        standard deviations as fully red, 0 as neutral (white or no background),
        and +2 as fully green. Values beyond this range should be clamped to the
        min/max color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Note that the color scaling should work for Pro and Amateur tables based
        on your previous refactor. Any style changes can be done globally by
        updating <strong>src/app.component.css</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
